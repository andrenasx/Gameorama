# A6: Indexes, triggers, user functions, transactions and population

This artefact contains the physical schema of the database, the identification and characterisation of the indexes, the support of data integrity rules with triggers and the definition of the database user-defined functions. This artefact also shows the database transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data in the presence of concurrent accesses. For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and justified and read-only transactions to improve global performance are identified and justified. Finally, it also contains the database's workload as well as the complete database creation script, including all SQL necessary to define all integrity constraints, indexes and triggers.

## 1. Database Workload

Understanding the nature of the workload for the application, and the performance goals, is essential to developing a good database design. The workload includes:

- the most important queries (SELECT) and how often they arise
- the most important modifications (UPDATE, DELETE) and how often they arise
- the desired performance for these queries and updates
- an estimate of the number of tuples for each relation

### 1.1. Tuple Estimation

The following table includes an estimation of the number of tuples and growth for each relation

| **Relation reference** | **Relation Name** | **Order of magnitude**        | **Estimated growth** |

## 2. Proposed Indices

### 2.1. Performance Indexes

The following tables display the indexes proposed to improve performance of the identified queries.  

| **Index**           | IDX01                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Related queries** | SELECT03                                                     |
| **Relation**        | news_post                                                    |
| **Attribute**       | date_time                                                    |
| **Type**            | B-tree                                                       |
| **Cardinality**     | Low                                                          |
| **Clustering**      | No                                                           |
| **Justification**   | This index allows the news posts to be searched by date faster. Allowing the mainpage information to be loaded quickly. |

####  SQL Code:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS news_post_date;
CREATE INDEX post_date ON news_post USING btree (date_time);
```



| **Index**           | IDX02                                                        |

### 2.2. Full-text Search Indexes

The following tables specify the indexes created in order to achieve full-text search and its features.

| **Index**           | IDX08                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Related queries** | SELECT26                                                     |
| **Relation**        | news_post                                                    |
| **Attribute**       | title                                                        |
| **Type**            | GiST                                                         |
| **Clustering**      | No                                                           |
| **Justification**   | To improve the performance of full text searches while searching for news posts' titles. The type of this index is GiST because it's better for dynamic data. |

####  SQL Code:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS search_posts;
CREATE INDEX search_posts ON news_post USING gist (to_tsvector('english', title));
```



| **Index**           | IDX09                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Related queries** | SELECT27                                                     |
| **Relation**        | member                                                       |
| **Attribute**       | username                                                     |
| **Type**            | GiST                                                         |
| **Clustering**      | No                                                           |
| **Justification**   | To improve the performance of full text searches while searching for members' usenames. The type of this index is GiST because it's better for dynamic data. |

####  SQL Code:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS member_username;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS member_username ON member USING gist (to_tsvector('english', username));
```



| **Index**           | IDX10                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Related queries** | SELECT28                                                     |
| **Relation**        | topic                                                        |
| **Attribute**       | name                                                         |
| **Type**            | GIN                                                          |
| **Clustering**      | No                                                           |
| **Justification**   | To improve the performance of full text searches while searching for topics' names. Seeing that this table is infrequently updated the type of index used is GIN, which take longer to create/update but lead to faster lookups. |

#### SQL Code:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS topic_name;
CREATE INDEX topic_name ON topic USING gin (to_tsvector('english', name));
```

### 2.3. Contraint-enforcing Indexes

The following table specifies the index used to enforce special unique constraints, such as guaranteeing uniqueness of case insensitive usernames, emails and topic names.

```sql
CREATE INDEX unique_lowercase_username ON member (lower(username));
CREATE INDEX unique_lowercase_email ON member (lower(email));
CREATE INDEX unique_lowercase_topic ON topic (lower(name));
```

## 3. Triggers

The following tables define the triggers and user-defined functions developed in order to maintain the system's data integrity.

| **Trigger**      | TRIGGER01                              |
| ---              | ---                                    |
| **Description**  | When a post already has a vote (upvote or downvote)  and a member changes its vote, the old vote is removed and the post's and its owner's aura score is updated (+2 on upvotes or -2 on downvotes) |

####  SQL Code:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_post_aura CASCADE;
CREATE FUNCTION update_post_aura() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF NEW.upvote AND NOT OLD.upvote THEN
      UPDATE news_post
        SET aura = aura + 2
        WHERE NEW.id_post = news_post.id;

## 4. Transactions

The following tables display the transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data in the presence of concurrent accesses.  

| **T01**   |  Insert replies                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   |  It is necessary to ensure a ROLLBACK in case any of the transaction's instructions result in an error. The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because, otherwise, an update of comment_id_seq could happen, due to an insert in the table comment committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, inconsistent data would be stored. |
| Isolation level | REPEATABLE READ                     |

#### SQL Code:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

    INSERT INTO comment (body, id_member, id_post) VALUES ($body, $id_member, $id_post);
    INSERT INTO reply (id_comment, id_parent) VALUES (currval('comment_id_seq'), $id_parent);

COMMIT;
